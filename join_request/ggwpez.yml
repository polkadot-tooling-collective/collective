about: >
  I started to work with Polkadot in 2022 after coming from the Ethereum world.
  Polkadot immediately grabbed my attention for its impressive tech stack - not
  so much the UI/UX 😅.  
  I am still excited by Polkadot and think that we can have a big impact on the future by helping it grow.
motivation: >
  Polkadot has the best tech, now we just need to make it easy to use.

  I saw the Decentralization happening and thought that now would be a
  good time to add some Dev Tooling to the list of decentralized funded
  projects. I would be happy to be part of a DAO in a permission- and trustless way.
