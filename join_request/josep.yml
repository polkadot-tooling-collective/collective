about: Technical Lead of the Polkadot-API team. Since late 2021, I have been
  actively involved in the Polkadot ecosystem, contributing to the development
  of various tools.
motivation: I am committed to continuously enhancing the tools that will empower
  both myself and others to develop decentralized applications on Polkadot.
  Additionally, I am eager to collaborate with other tool developers, including
  the Chopsticks team, to create synergies that improve the overall developer
  experience on Polkadot.
