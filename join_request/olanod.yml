about: Founder of Virto, a treasury funded initiative to develop Polkadot
  technology to create real-word impact. Since early 2020 I have been developing
  tools in the ecosystem with the goal of enabling the creation of lightweight
  and simple to use applications that work on ANY patform(e.g. web, mobile, server, embedded),
  it includes wallets(libwallet), blockchain clients(sube+scales) and we 
  keep researching ways to make building cross chain applications even easier.
  All this initiatives are now maintained by the Virto team under the "VirtoSDK" umbrella.
motivation: With Virto, I want to bring our great blockchain technology to the masses
where users don't need to care what kind of sorcery powers such a great user experience.
