about:
  Member of Polkadot-API team. Previously, I contributed inside Zondax to Polkadot (and other
  Substrate-based chains) Ledger HW integration.
motivation: I'd like to continue improving the Polkadot tooling, mainly focused
  on Polkadot-API development. I'd also like to collaborate closely with other
  projects to improve the tools around Polkadot and encourage new developers to
  embark on a journey in Polkadot.
