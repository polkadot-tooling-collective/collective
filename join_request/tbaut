about:  Former Parity employee since 2018, I'm now working at Chainsafe for the
  past 3 years. I've built, contributed and presented a number of products and
  libraries. I won't list the products such as Polkadot Vault (ex Parity
  Signer), Polkassembly, Stylo or Multix that I created, but seat on the edge
  between actual products or tools. One of the most recent tool I built is a
  polkadot wallet integrated into an e2e testing framework called Cypress.
  Connected to Chopsticks, devs can fully test Dapps as if users interacted with
  them using a wallet extension.
