about: CPA, Finance Bachelor, main maintainer of Txwrapper-core and collaborator
  of Substrate API Sidecar, Asset Transfer API, asset_cli_tool, and Polkadot-JS.
motivation: Polkadot needs to be accessible in order to grow and become more
  attractive for projects, and the tools we maintain are a big part of that.
  These tools are meant as a way to facilitate building on Polkadot and as such
  I think that their continued maintenance and development is essential, which
  entails hours of research, development and keeping up with all the changes in
  the runtime, clients, and the needs and wants of the ecosystem, so having
  visibility and recognition for our job is from part of the Polkadot community
  a great thing, specially if it comes with a DOT remuneration to help us
  dedicate more time to these tools.
