about: Founder of Virto, a treasury funded initiative to develop Polkadot
  technology to create real-word impact.
motivation: With the Virto team I have developed several client side tools now
  packed under the "virto-sdk" repository that help creating lightweight
  applications that work on ANY platform with the same code base(web, mobile,
  server, embedded). It including wallets(libwallet), blockchain
  clients(sube+scales) and we keep researching ways to make building cross chain
  applications even easier.
