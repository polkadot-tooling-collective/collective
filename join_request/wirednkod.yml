about: "I am Nikolaos Kontakis, starting in the beginning of 2021 as a Parity employee and for 3 years, I was working on Polkadot related tools/projects, mainly on Substrate-Connect and Zombienet. In addition to my professional commitments, I have dedicated my free time to crafting a UI library for polkadot (polkadot-ui - https://polkadot-ui.info). Currently I am working with Polkadot Blockchain Academy. In PolkadotJS, I've made contributions to Apps and API, particularly in the context of the integration with substrate-connect and light clients;I am one of the top contributors of Substrate-connect, and Zombienet."
motivation: "My motivation is to build tools for making the web2 users to have an easier transition to web3 and find tools that will allow them faster to convert ideas to projects."
