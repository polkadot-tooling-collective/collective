# Polkadot Tooling Collective (PoToC)

This repository holds a list of all members, requests for admission and work evidence of the Polkadot Tooling Collective as defined by its [constitution](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/constitution).  
The files are managed by the [collective-cli](https://github.com/super-collective/collective-cli) to keep all files neatly sorted and in a machine-readable format. This allows for auditability and better accountability of past decisions.

## Structure

This repo consists of three main folders as configured by its `collective.yaml` file:
- `member`: All members of the collective.
- `join_request`: All accepted requests for admission.
- `work_evidence`: Proof of done work.

All the structural decisions here are made in line with the guidelines of the [super-collective](https://github.com/super-collective) to act as Proof-of-Concept for it.

## How to Join (Request for Admission)

> *NOTE* At the current time we only accept accomplished developers. Please refrain from applying if you did not contribute to the mission of PoToC in the past.

To join PoToc, please fork this repository and create a Request for Admission, following [this](https://github.com/super-collective/collective-cli/blob/7d4a1a785396a2e29199a3d16115b67a4e8d9054/schema/potoc.join_request.schema.json) format. You can also use the [CLI](https://github.com/super-collective/collective-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-a-request-for-admission---interactive) to create the file. In either case, please read the [constitution](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/constitution) and acknowledge the mission of PoToC.

Then please open a Merge Request to this repository to add your request file. It should be in the `join_request` folder. See the application from [Nikos](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/collective/pull/1) as example. Once that is merged, you are a member of PoToC!  An entry in the `member` folder will be created for you to reflect this.

### Example

To give you an idea of what it could look like, here is an example of a request for admission. Sure there should be a bit more content, but you get the idea.

```yaml

## Work Evidence

PoToC promises to the Polkadot Tokenholders to regularly post evidence of its past work. This is done in a machine readable format following [this](https://github.com/super-collective/collective-cli/blob/1d019d4dd5120db8f8517df7bfb64d19eac74b69/schema/evidence_report.json) yaml schema. Again, it is possible to create, check and render these files. Please refer to the [collective-cli](https://github.com/super-collective/collective-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-evidence---interactive) repo for more info.
