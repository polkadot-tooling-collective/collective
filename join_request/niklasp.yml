about: Frontend Dev with over 2 years in the Polkadot Ecosystem working in
  different treasury funded projects with react and next.js. Worked for
  polkadot.study, WagMedia, TheKus and recently first PR to useInkathon which I
  want to develop further.
motivation: I want to improve Developer Experience as I myself had a steep
  learning curve with Polkadot at the beginning. There are many tools on my mind
  that should be build to make onboarding dApp developers easier by e.g.
  providing templates for popular frameworks like next.js and reusable
  react  components for developers. With a regular income from the Tooling
  collective I could make sure that "I could go the extra mile" of making
  components I use in dApps regularly reusable and bundling it into packages so
  they can be collectively used and improved by the community.
