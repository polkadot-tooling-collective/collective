about: >-
  Software engineer, with background on computer science.

  Professionally, for the last 10 years I've been specialising in frontend of
  real-time data systems: Risk asset management, market technical indicators,
  and trading platforms with a monthly volume of up to 12 billion USD, with 3500
  filled orders per day.

  I've also built a library (as co-author) for bindings between React and RxJS,
  which helps make applications with react that deal with real-time state.

  Recently I have shifted to work on the polkadot blockchain, to build a library
  for dApp developers, light-client first. I've recently been admitted to join
  the Polkadot Blockchain Academy in Singapore to deepen my knowledge on this
  technology.
motivation: >-
  I have a long-term vision of creating better tools for dApp developers,
  getting involved with the community and finding new challenges to be solved.

  I think there's a long road ahead, which much to learn as well as much to
  contribute.
